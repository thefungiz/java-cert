### Welcome!

This project is intended to be a sandbox for our team to try out and become comfortable with Java 11 and prepare for the certifications.

### Getting Started  
* Create a Github account
* Clone the project to your local
* Add your home package to the project ex. src/main/java/thefungiz/javacert
* Add a Runner class that has a main method that prints out a message
* Add a README.md file to your home. This will be a place to put notes
* Commit and push

### Markdown
*.md files use markdown syntax and allow you to style your notes.
A full description of the markdown syntax can be found here - https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/
